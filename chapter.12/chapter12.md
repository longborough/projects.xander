### Computational algorithms

* Terminate x efficiently

### What kinds of problem

* Additional applications examples\
  Airline facre construction and revenue optimisation

* Q1: Who else uses 
encryption algorithms?\
  Internet -- not just credit card 
  and personal info
  details, but almost everything nowadays\
  Some security systems encrypt passwords
  (eg password managers)\ 
  Instant messaging systems\
  Mobile phone transmission\
  Computer file systems / external storage

### A simple computational algorithm

* Efficiently. Hmmm....

* Q2: No, don't

* Q3: Failures:\
Doesn't allow for invalid inputs\
Doesn't always terminate 
(for invalid inputs)\
Not efficient\
Apart from that, fine

* Useful functional definition is
a prerequisite for a good algorithm, IMO.

### Divide and Conquer

* Are we going to program 
this right now?
